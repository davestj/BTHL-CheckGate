### Core Requirements

**We need** to scaffold out a Windows C# project for Visual Studio 2022 with the following specifications:

#### Application Architecture
- **Console-based C# application** with command line parameter support
- **Windows Service capability** - runs as background service in Windows 11 Pro Service Manager
- **HTTP/HTTPS interface** on port 9300 with full threaded support
- **Multi-client access** for concurrent user sessions
- **REST API v1** accessible at `https://localhost:9300/api/v1`

#### System Monitoring Capabilities
**We require** comprehensive system resource monitoring including:
- **CPU usage** - real-time processor utilization across all cores
- **Memory usage** - physical and virtual memory consumption
- **Hard drives** - disk space monitoring for all mounted drives  
- **Storage metrics** - used and available space reporting
- **Resource Manager API** - programmatic access to Windows system metrics

#### Authentication & Security
**We implement** multi-layered authentication:
- **Web Admin Area** - Windows system user authentication
- **Local user accounts** - non-cloud based authentication
- **Administrator privileges** - default 'Administrator' account support
- **Multiple auth methods** - password, PIN, or Windows Hello authentication
- **API Authentication** - JWT Bearer token methods for REST endpoints

#### Testing & Validation
**We provide** comprehensive testing capabilities:
- **Test client application** - API endpoint validation and testing
- **Interactive testing** - command line and GUI-based test scenarios

#### Container & Orchestration
**We integrate** modern containerization:
- **Kubernetes monitoring** - cluster health and performance metrics
- **Docker Desktop integration** - local Kubernetes cluster support
- **Container orchestration** - workload monitoring and resource tracking

#### Database Integration  
**We utilize** enterprise database capabilities:
- **Local MySQL 8 server** - dedicated database instance
- **Custom schema design** - optimized for monitoring data storage
- **C# MySQL libraries** - Entity Framework Core integration
- **Data persistence** - historical metrics and audit logging

#### Development Tooling
**We establish** professional development environment:
- **Visual Studio 2022 Professional** - primary development IDE
- **Project scaffolding** - complete solution structure
- **Claude Code integration** - AI-assisted development continuation
- **Documentation framework** - CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md for project continuity

#### Frontend Dashboard
**We deliver** modern web interface:
- **React.js or pure WinJS** - responsive admin dashboard
- **Interactive graphs** - real-time data visualization
- **Modern responsive design** - enterprise-level user experience  
- **Web monitoring** - browser-based system oversight

#### CI/CD Pipeline
**We implement** DevSecOps best practices:
- **GitHub Actions workflows** - automated build and deployment
- **MSBuild integration** - Windows-specific build strategies
- **C# lint checking** - code quality enforcement
- **Compilation strategies** - optimized build processes

#### Security Integration
**We prioritize** comprehensive security testing:
- **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** - source code analysis
- **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** - runtime vulnerability scanning  
- **Swagger templates** - API security documentation
- **Security-first approach** - integrated throughout development lifecycle
