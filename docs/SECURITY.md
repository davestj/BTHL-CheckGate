## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**We welcome** responsible security research and disclosure of vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**For security issues, please do not use GitHub Issues.** Instead:

1. **Email**: security@bthlcorp.com
2. **Subject**: [SECURITY] Brief description of the issue
3. **Encryption**: Use PGP key (see below) for sensitive information

### What to Include

**We need** the following information for effective triage:

- **Vulnerability Description**: Clear explanation of the security issue
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the system are impacted
- **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability could be exploited
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (if safe to include)
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential consequences of exploitation
- **Suggested Fix**: Recommendations for remediation (if known)

### Example Security Report

```
Subject: [SECURITY] JWT Token Validation Bypass in API Authentication

Description:
The JWT token validation in BTHLCheckGate.Security.Services.JwtTokenService 
can be bypassed by sending a malformed token, allowing unauthorized access 
to protected API endpoints.

Affected Components:
- BTHLCheckGate.Security project
- All API controllers using [Authorize] attribute
- JWT middleware in Startup.cs

Attack Vector:
1. Send API request with malformed Bearer token
2. Token validation fails silently
3. Request proceeds as if authenticated

Impact:
- Complete authentication bypass
- Unauthorized access to system metrics
- Potential data exposure

Reproduction:
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer malformed-token" 
     https://localhost:9300/api/v1/systemmetrics/current
```

## üîê Security Response Process

**We follow** a structured process for handling security reports:

### 1. Acknowledgment (24 hours)
- **Confirm receipt** of the security report
- **Assign tracking number** (SEC-YYYY-NNN format)
- **Initial severity assessment**

### 2. Investigation (48-72 hours)
- **Reproduce the vulnerability** in controlled environment
- **Assess impact and scope** of the security issue
- **Determine affected versions** and components
- **Develop remediation plan**

### 3. Resolution (1-2 weeks)
- **Implement security fix** in development environment
- **Comprehensive testing** of the fix
- **Security review** of the solution
- **Prepare security advisory**

### 4. Disclosure (Coordinated)
- **Notify reporter** of fix timeline
- **Prepare public advisory** with technical details
- **Release patched version**
- **Publish security advisory**

### Response Timeline

## üéØ Security Architecture

**We built** BTHL CheckGate with security as a foundational principle:

    C --> D
    D --> I
    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> I
    H --> I
```

### Security Controls Implementation

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
```csharp
// Multi-layered authentication
[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
[RequireRateLimit("admin")]
public class AdminController : ControllerBase
{
    // Role-based access control
    // Rate limiting protection
    // JWT token validation
}
```

#### **Input Validation**
```csharp
public class SystemMetricsRequest
{
    [Required]
    [StringLength(255, MinimumLength = 1)]
    [RegularExpression(@"^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_.]+$")]
    public string Hostname { get; set; }
    
    [Range(typeof(DateTime), "2020-01-01", "2030-12-31")]
    public DateTime StartDate { get; set; }
}
```

#### **Database Security**
```csharp
// Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
public async Task<List<SystemMetrics>> GetMetricsByHostnameAsync(string hostname)
{
    return await _context.SystemMetrics
        .Where(m => m.Hostname == hostname)  // EF Core parameterization
        .OrderByDescending(m => m.Timestamp)
        .Take(100)
        .ToListAsync();
}
```

---

## üîç Security Testing

**We implement** comprehensive security testing throughout development:

### Automated Security Testing

#### **SAST (Static Analysis)**
- **Security Code Scan**: .NET security analyzer
- **DevSkim**: Microsoft security linter
- **SonarCloud**: Code quality and security analysis
- **Dependency Check**: Vulnerable package detection

#### **DAST (Dynamic Analysis)**
- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated penetration testing
- **Custom Security Tests**: Authentication bypass testing
- **API Security Testing**: Input validation and injection testing
- **SSL/TLS Testing**: Certificate and encryption validation

#### **Security Regression Testing**
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task AuthenticateAsync_WithSqlInjectionPayload_ReturnsFailure()
{
    // Arrange
    var maliciousInput = "admin'; DROP TABLE users; --";
    
    // Act
    var result = await _authService.AuthenticateAsync(maliciousInput, "password");
    
    // Assert
    Assert.False(result.IsSuccess);
    Assert.DoesNotContain("DROP TABLE", GetDatabaseLogs());
}

[Fact]
public async Task GetMetrics_WithMalformedJwt_Returns401()
{
    // Arrange
    var client = CreateClientWithToken("malformed.jwt.token");
    
    // Act
    var response = await client.GetAsync("/api/v1/systemmetrics/current");
    
    // Assert
    Assert.Equal(HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized, response.StatusCode);
}
```

### Manual Security Testing

**We perform** regular manual security assessments:

- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly external assessments
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused peer reviews
- **Architecture Reviews**: Security design validation
- **Configuration Audits**: Security setting verification

| Hard-coded JWT Secret | Critical | Use environment variables | v1.0.1 |
| Missing Input Sanitization | High | Implement HTML encoding | v1.0.1 |
| Insufficient Rate Limiting | Medium | Per-user rate limits | v1.1.0 |
| Debug Info in Production | Low | Remove debug endpoints | v1.1.0 |

### Production Deployment Warnings

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before deploying to production**:

1. **Change default JWT secret** in configuration
2. **Configure proper SSL certificates** 
3. **Review and harden database permissions**
4. **Implement network segmentation**
5. **Configure monitoring and alerting**
6. **Perform security testing** in production-like environment

### Security Assumptions

**We assume** the following in our security model:

- **Trusted Network**: Internal corporate network environment
- **Physical Security**: Server hardware is physically secure
- **Administrative Access**: System administrators are trusted
- **Database Security**: MySQL instance is properly secured
- **Certificate Management**: SSL/TLS certificates are properly managed

## üõ†Ô∏è Secure Development Practices

**We follow** secure coding guidelines:

### Secure Coding Standards

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user input at entry points
   - Use allowlists instead of blocklists
   - Implement proper length and format checks

2. **Output Encoding**
   - HTML encode all user-generated content
   - Use parameterized queries for database access
   - Implement proper JSON encoding

3. **Authentication & Session Management**
   - Use strong password requirements
   - Implement proper session timeout
   - Use secure random number generation

4. **Error Handling**
   - Don't expose sensitive information in errors
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Implement proper exception handling

5. **Cryptography**
   - Use established cryptographic libraries
   - Implement proper key management
   - Use strong encryption algorithms
